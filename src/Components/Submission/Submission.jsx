Each accepted contribution must have at least one paid registration by the time the camera-ready paper is submitted for inclusion in the proceedings. <strong>IEEE MPSec ICETA reserves the right to remove from IEEE Xplore papers and posters not presented at the symposium.</strong>The conference is planned to be conducted in a hybrid manner, and if the authors cannot attend the conference in person, they will be allowed to present online.</p>
